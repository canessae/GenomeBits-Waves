# GenomeBits-Waves

Sound waves (wav audio files) generated via GenomeBits alternating sums algorithm.

By transforming the occurrence of nucleotides of the same type along the genome sequences, sound waves (wav audio files) can be generated via GenomeBits. Example is given. In these calculations, we use parameters as sample rate: 4096, precision: 16-bit, duration: 2:46.28 min for 681097 samples: le size: 1.36M: bit rate: 65.5k and sample encoding: 16-bit in 1 channel.

An anologous time-frequency representation of the strand of genome data, showing homogeneous peak signals over time, is shown in the figure in the form of spectrogram. Each data point in the audio curves has been fitted to a gaussian function to correlate a continuous audio spectrum in the analysis of our waveform reconstruction.
